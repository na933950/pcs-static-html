    <h1>Political Computer Science @ Berkeley</h1>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the OCF (Berkeley web hosting services) is giving us some
      difficulty. We hope to have our full (and nicely designed) site up and
      running very soon. For now, please appreciate this web page, or feel free
      to visit
      <a href="https://pcs-svelte.vercel.app/about">our vercel draft</a> which
      is an unofficial draft of our website and does not represent the OCF or
      Berkeley.
